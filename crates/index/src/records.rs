//! Typed query results (IMPROVEMENTS #7): the single serde record schema every machine
//! surface serializes — MCP `structuredContent` today, the Node/Python index sessions next
//! (#8). The rendered-text surfaces stay byte-stable for humans; these records are the
//! contract for programs, so every field is explicit (ids, durable ids, grades, spans) and
//! nothing requires parsing prose.
//!
//! Selector-driven queries return [`Selected`], preserving the ambiguity semantics of the
//! rendered surfaces: `NoMatch` and `Ambiguous` are answers, not errors — an ambiguous name
//! hands back the candidate records to refine with (`path`/`kind`/`id`/`eid`).
