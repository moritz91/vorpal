//! Per-file extraction products — the incremental-rebuild cache unit (§3.4).
//!
//! A [`FileProduct`] is everything extraction learns from one file: its outline items and its
//! references, the latter keyed by the *entity path* of their enclosing definition (stable
//! across runs) rather than a `NodeId` (assigned per run). Re-indexing re-parses only changed
//! files and replays cached products for unchanged ones; the graph is always re-linked from the
//! complete product set, so removals and renames cannot leave stale nodes or edges behind.
//!
//! The on-disk form is a hand-rolled little-endian binary (`.vpb`), matching the repo's other
//! formats (manifest, edges, ANN): no field names, no escaping, no text numbers — the JSON it
//! replaced carried ~5.7× write amplification and a String-heavy parse on every replay. Every
//! decode is bounds-checked and versioned; any mismatch is an error the incremental path treats
//! as a cache miss.

/// The extraction-product format generation. Bumped whenever extraction output changes shape or
/// semantics (fields, suppression rules, qualifier capture, encoding), so stale caches replay
/// as cache misses and re-parse — staleness is structural, never silent (§3.4). v8 adds the
/// grammar-generation digest to the header; v9 widens the parse-error flag to an error-node
/// count; v10 captures source-module qualifiers on import references (Python `from X import y`,
/// Rust `use a::b::c`); v11 adds affected-byte counts and representative merged error spans
/// (parse health beyond a scalar, IMPROVEMENTS #11); v12 carries the aliased-import local
/// rebinding (`from x import y as z` → alias `z`), so import bindings can key on the name
/// bare uses actually say; v13 adds the MethodHinted form — member-access receivers ride as
/// owner hints (`Foo.bar()` corroborates class Foo) instead of being discarded.
/// v14 (G-M1): refs carry receiver/receiver-type/args; products carry per-entity params.
/// The version check itself is this bump's invalidation — v13 bytes never decode, so every
/// file re-extracts exactly once.
// 18: SymbolType tags 28–30 (Macro/Union/TypeAlias — extraction-coverage campaign);
// older caches re-parse under the new rules rather than replaying pre-campaign
// products that lack the new symbol classes.
// 19: the two development lines merged — 17 (`struct X y;` staged type uses, lean
// records) and 18 (the coverage kinds) carried DIFFERENT semantics under different
// numbers, and the merged extraction differs from both; neither line's cached
// products may replay against it.
// 20: parser-swallow recoveries (`swallows`, after the error spans) — the structural
// coverage signal beside the byte ratio. The decoders reject trailing bytes, so no
// compatible extension existed; the bump costs nothing extra because the C rule edit
// that arms recovery re-keys every product through the rules digest anyway.
// 21 (never shipped; its layout moved three times under one number — a bench index written
// by one intermediate binary was misread by the next, so the number moved on):
// 22: top-level cuts (`cuts`, right after the parse-health header) — the byte offset of
// every direct child of the parse root, delta-LEB128 with the child's `has_error` flag in
// the low bit. A pattern match is one node, so it lies inside exactly one top-level child;
// the structural searches parse only the children that hold the pattern's literal (each
// alone, as a tree-sitter included range) and stay exact for error-free children — a child
// tree-sitter recovered is parsed with its file, because recovery is context-dependent.
// Header-relative so `peek_product_cuts` never decodes items or refs; a `refs_off` u32
// before the cuts (offset 52) lets `peek_product_refs` read the reference rows without the
// outline; every call reference carries its call shape (`arity << 2 | opaque << 1 | plain`).
// 23: parse health counts MISSING tokens alongside ERROR nodes; layout unchanged.
// Re-key products so a prior missing-only tree cannot replay as clean.
