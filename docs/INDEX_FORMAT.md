# Index-format compatibility and migration policy

The version table below is maintained by `crates/index/tests/format_policy.rs` — it is
regenerated from the constants in source, so this document cannot drift from the code.

## Store identity

An index root holds `CURRENT` (a pointer file naming `gen/<content-id>`), immutable
content-addressed generation directories, and a root-level `products/` loose bank. A build
stages a complete new generation and commits it with one atomic pointer swap; readers see
the whole old index or the whole new one, never a mixture. GC keeps the new and prior
generations. A legacy flat root (no `CURRENT`) is read as-is and migrated into a generation
by its first rebuild (pinned by `legacy_flat_index_migrates_on_rebuild`).

## Format selection

The **bucketed** family layout is the default: products in `products/<k>.pack` +
`products/toc.bin`, nodes/evidence/edges/usage/sigs in per-bucket slabs with per-slab TOC
digests, generation identity as a Merkle fold of the family TOCs. It is what makes
incremental builds O(changed) — unchanged buckets hard-link across generations and the
scoped composes (stamp-cutoff / respan / defs-stable / defs-changed) splice buckets instead
of rewriting the corpus.

`VORPAL_FORMAT` selects the write format for the generation being built:

- unset, empty, or `next` — bucketed (the default; `next` is the historical opt-in name,
  kept as an explicit synonym),
- `flat` — the deprecated legacy monolithic layout (`products.pack`/`products.idx`,
  single-segment `nodes.vseg`, monolithic sidecars). An escape hatch only; it will be
  removed with v1 retirement,
- any other non-empty value — stamped to the phase log and treated as the default.

Readers are format-agnostic: both layouts load through the same surfaces, so existing flat
indexes keep serving and migrate to bucketed on their first rebuild (rebuild is the
migration, policy #1). The format is a property of a generation, never mixed within one.

## Policy

1. **Rebuild is the migration.** Graph segments are never migrated in place: a format bump
   means the next build re-derives everything from source, deterministically, into a new
   content-addressed generation. Builds are bit-reproducible, so migration is exact by
   construction.
2. **Caches retire by version; they are never reinterpreted.** Extraction products carry
   `PRODUCT_FORMAT_VERSION`; any mismatch is a cache miss that re-parses. Version bumps are
   mandatory whenever extraction output changes shape **or semantics** (the constant's doc
   comment records the history).
3. **Readers fail loudly or degrade honestly — never misread.** Foreign or newer graph
   segments fail `Kg::load` with an explicit error. Optional sidecars (evidence, ANN,
   postings, names) that are missing, stale, or foreign make their features answer
   "unavailable" (or fall back to exact-but-slower paths) while queries stay correct.
4. **Additive sidecars are the only writes an existing generation admits**, and each must be
   self-validating: the ANN tier and posting tier are stamped with the node-segment hash
   (plus model provenance for ANN); `names.idx` is backfilled once and validated on read;
   the text tier (`trigrams/<k>.tri`) validates **per bucket** against a fold of that
   bucket's per-file source digests, so a bucket whose files changed reads as uncovered
   (its files scan exhaustively) until the daemon's next warm rebuilds it — a from-scratch
   build never writes it, the compose lanes delta it, and `commit_generation` hard-links
   it forward like the ANN tier. None of these sidecars enters generation identity.
5. **The durable identities are external ids (`eid:<32 hex>`) and the source tree**, not the
   on-disk format. Pre-1.0, the index format is explicitly not a cross-version interchange
   format; nothing needs migrating because nothing is lost by rebuilding.

## Version and freshness table

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED VERSION TABLE -->
| Artifact | Constant | Value | On mismatch |
|---|---|---|---|
| extraction products (`products/*.vpb`, pack bodies) | `PRODUCT_FORMAT_VERSION` (crates/ingest/src/product.rs) | 24 | cache miss → re-parse |
| product pack, bucketed layout (`products/<k>.pack` + `products/toc.bin`) — the default | `BUCKET_VERSION` (crates/ingest/src/pack.rs) | 1 | pack ignored → rebuilt by next build |
| product pack, legacy flat layout (`products.pack`/`products.idx`) — deprecated, written only under `VORPAL_FORMAT=flat`; reads retained | `PACK_VERSION` (crates/ingest/src/pack.rs) | 2 | pack ignored → rebuilt by next build |
| graph segments (`*.vseg`, `strings.heap`, `graph.bin`) | `FORMAT_VERSION` (crates/segment/src/format.rs) | 2 | `Kg::load` fails loudly → rebuild |
| evidence sidecar (`evidence.bin`) | `VERSION` (crates/kg/src/evidence.rs) | 2 | sidecar treated as absent → `why` reports no evidence |
| edge slabs (`edges/<k>.bin` + toc) | `VERSION` (crates/kg/src/edgestore.rs) | 1 | family treated as absent → scoped composes decline; next full build rewrites it |
| usage postings (`usage/<k>.bin` + toc) | `VERSION` (crates/kg/src/usagestore.rs) | 1 | family treated as absent → scoped composes decline; next full build rewrites it |
| sigs sketch ledger (`sigs/<k>.bin` + toc) | `VERSION` (crates/kg/src/sigstore.rs) | 2 | prior generation neither reused nor composed from → full pipeline rebuilds the family |
| include-reach graph (`reach.bin`) | `REACH_GRAPH_VERSION` (crates/resolve/src/reach.rs) | 2 | scoped composes decline (reach oracle unreplayable) → full pipeline rebuilds it |
| data-flow sidecar (`dataflow.bin`) | `VERSION` (crates/kg/src/dataflow.rs) | 1 | load fails loudly → rebuild (absent file ≠ mismatch: older generations answer no flows) |
| lexical posting tier (`postings.bin`) | `VERSION` (crates/index/src/postings.rs) | 2 | scan fallback → the daemon heals it when it pins the generation; a warm rebuilds it |
| embedding semantics (`ann.model.json`) | `LEXICAL_EMBED_VERSION` (crates/ann/src/embed.rs) | 2 | ANN tier distrusted → exact fallback → warm rebuilds |
| calls-graph communities (`communities.bin`) | `VERSION` (crates/kg/src/communities.rs) | 1 | sidecar treated as absent → `community` answers `null`, `architecture` says not built → warm rebuilds |
| semantic engine calibration (`ann.calib`) | `ANN_CALIB_VERSION` (crates/index/src/lib.rs) | 1 | calibration treated as absent → structural routing floor (full-population fetches scan; the beam keeps everything below) → next warm re-measures |
| learned embedding model (`ann.model.bin`) | `LEARNED_MODEL_VERSION` (crates/ann/src/learned/persist.rs) | 3 | model unreadable/stale → lexical fallback stated in provenance → warm retrains |
| text tier — trigram postings per file bucket (`trigrams/<k>.tri` + `trigrams/toc.bin`), a sidecar outside generation identity | `VERSION` (crates/kg/src/trigramstore.rs) | 1 | bucket treated as absent → its files scan exhaustively → the daemon's next warm heals it from source |
<!-- END GENERATED VERSION TABLE -->

The ANN tier itself (`ann.bin` + `ann.files` + `ann.stamp`) is freshness-gated by the
node-segment stamp and the persisted model provenance rather than a standalone format
version: any mismatch routes queries to the exact fallback until a re-warm rebuilds it.
The reference spill (`.refs.spill`) is process-private scratch — created, read once, and
deleted within a single build; it is deliberately unversioned and never persisted.

Textual C++ include contexts require `source_contexts.json` whenever graph nodes carry
original definition provenance. This version-1 artifact enters generation identity and
binds each durable node identity to its original physical source parts, reference sites,
and all input digests. Missing, incomplete, foreign, or mismatched provenance fails graph
loading; it cannot be treated as an optional feature. Ordinary graphs need no such file.
Product version 24 carries the corresponding definition and reference context metadata.
Segment version 2 prevents version-1 graph readers from ignoring the required node flag
and interpreting foreign-file evidence offsets as offsets in the owner's file. Rebuilding
also upgrades ordinary generations; graph artifacts are never migrated in place.
Context builds reparse the complete configured group and validate every input again before
publishing a generation, including deferred live publication.
